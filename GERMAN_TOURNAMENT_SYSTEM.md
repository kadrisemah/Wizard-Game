## 🧮 Complete Logic for ALL Player Counts

### **Professional Analysis & Extrapolation**

Based on the pattern from your paper (6 players), I've calculated the optimal elimination schedule for each player count:

### **6 Players** (From Your Paper) ✓

```
Starting: 6 players
Round 10: Eliminate 1 → 5 players remain
Round 12: Eliminate 1 → 4 players remain
Round 15: Eliminate 1 → 3 players remain
Rounds 16-20: Final 3 players compete

Schedule: [10, 12, 15]
Goal: Reach 3 players by round 15, play final 5 rounds
```

### **5 Players** (Calculated)

```
Starting: 5 players
Round 10: Eliminate 1 → 4 players remain
Round 15: Eliminate 1 → 3 players remain
Rounds 16-20: Final 3 players compete

Schedule: [10, 15]
Logic: Need 2 eliminations, spread them similar to 6-player pattern
```

### **4 Players** (Calculated)

```
Starting: 4 players
Round 15: Eliminate 1 → 3 players remain
Rounds 16-20: Final 3 players compete

Schedule: [15]
Logic: Need 1 elimination, do it at round 15 like final elimination in 6-player
```

### **3 Players** (Already at Goal)

```
Starting: 3 players
No eliminations needed
Play all 20 rounds

Schedule: []
Logic: Already at target of 3 players
```

### **2 Players** (Head-to-Head)

```
Starting: 2 players
No eliminations
Head-to-head competition until round 20

Schedule: []
Logic: Can't eliminate anyone, head-to-head match
```

## 🎯 The Pattern Explained

### **Key Principle:**
**Always aim for 3 final players at round 20**

### **Why 3 Players?**
- In standard Wizard: 3 players = 20 rounds max (60 cards ÷ 3 = 20)
- This is the natural maximum for the game
- Allows for a proper championship finale

### **Elimination Timing Logic:**

| Players | Eliminations Needed | Schedule | Reasoning |
|---------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| **6** | 3 eliminations | 10, 12, 15 | Paper document pattern |
| **5** | 2 eliminations | 10, 15 | Skip round 12, keep round 10 & 15 |
| **4** | 1 elimination | 15 | Use final elimination round only |
| **3** | 0 eliminations | None | Already at goal |
| **2** | 0 eliminations | None | Head-to-head |

### **Mathematical Pattern:**

```
Round 10: First major elimination point (everyone has played 10 rounds)
Round 12: Mid-game adjustment (6 players only)
Round 15: Critical elimination point (3/4 through game)
Round 20: Tournament finale (always 3 players if eliminations active)
```

## 💻 Implementation Details

### **Code Structure:**

```javascript
function generateGermanEliminationSchedule(numPlayers) {
    const schedule = [];

    switch(numPlayers) {
        case 6:
            schedule.push(10, 12, 15);  // Paper document
            break;
        case 5:
            schedule.push(10, 15);       // Calculated
            break;
        case 4:
            schedule.push(15);           // Calculated
            break;
        case 3:
            // No eliminations
            break;
        case 2:
            // No eliminations
            break;
    }

    return schedule;
}
```

### **Automatic Elimination Process:**

1. **Check Round:** After each round, check if it's an elimination round
2. **Find Lowest:** Identify player(s) with lowest total score
3. **Eliminate ONE:** Remove only ONE player (lowest score)
4. **Update Display:** Mark eliminated, show which round
5. **Continue:** Game proceeds with remaining players

### **Danger Zone Warning:**

- Before elimination rounds (9, 11, 14), players with lowest score highlighted in **YELLOW**
- Status shows **"⚠️ Danger"** - they're at risk of elimination
- Pulsing animation draws attention
