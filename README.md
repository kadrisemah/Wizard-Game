## üöÄ Quick Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Push this repository to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: Deploy from main branch
   - Save and wait for deployment
   - Your site will be at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/`

### Step 2: Deploy the Server

The game needs a WebSocket server for online multiplayer. Deploy to Railway (recommended):

#### Option A: Railway (Easiest)

1. **Sign up at [Railway.app](https://railway.app/)**

2. **Create new project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select this repository

3. **Configure**
   - Railway auto-detects Node.js
   - No additional config needed
   - Get your deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

4. **Copy the server URL** - You'll need it for the next step

#### Option B: Heroku

1. **Install Heroku CLI and login**
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

2. **Create app**
   ```bash
   heroku create your-wizard-game
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

4. **Get URL**: `https://your-wizard-game.herokuapp.com`

### Step 3: Connect Game to Server

1. **Open** `wizard_game.html` in your code editor

2. **Find** the Socket.io initialization section (around line 6810):
   ```javascript
   // For GitHub Pages deployment, set your deployed server URL here:
   const DEPLOYED_SERVER = ''; // Leave empty if not deployed yet
   ```

3. **Update** with your server URL:
   ```javascript
   const DEPLOYED_SERVER = 'https://your-app.railway.app';
   ```

4. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add wizard_game.html
   git commit -m "Configure deployed server URL"
   git push
   ```

5. **Wait** for GitHub Pages to update (30-60 seconds)

### Step 4: Share with Friends

Share your GitHub Pages URL:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/
```

To force update, increment version:
```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = 'wizard-game-online-v2.0.1';
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Not connected to server" message

**If running locally:**
- Make sure `node server.js` is running
- Check server is on port 3000
- Try refreshing the page

**If deployed:**
- Check Railway/Heroku server is running
- Verify DEPLOYED_SERVER URL is correct in wizard_game.html
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### PWA not installing

- **HTTPS required** - GitHub Pages provides this automatically
- **Wait 5-10 seconds** - Service worker needs time to register
- **Try incognito mode** - To bypass cache issues
- **Check browser** - Use Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS)

### Room connection issues

- Both players must be connected to server
- Check internet connection
- Verify room code is correct (6 digits)
- Try creating new room
